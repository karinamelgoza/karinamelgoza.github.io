        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hello! I am Karina and I am studying web development at Devmountain. I graduated from Arizona State
            University
            (ASU) in 2018 with a degree in Medical Studies. I consider myself a lifelong student. Which is why a few
            years
            after graduating from ASU I was searching for something, specifically a career, that would nourish my inner
            student while I worked as a professional. This naturally led me to pursue software engineering in hopes of a
            fulfilling career. I am Mexican-American, and characteristically, family is very important to me. But
            besides
            enjoying time with my family, I also love to consume all kinds of media: books, movies, TV, music, and
            podcasts.
            My sister and I actually host a podcast about books. When I am not enveloped in a good book or movie, I like
            to
            play video games. There is so much to read, watch, and play, but so little time! In between all that I make
            sure
            to carve out some time where I can put on my headphones, play my favorite comfort music (Taylor Swift) and
            go
            out for a run.
